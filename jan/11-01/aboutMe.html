    <h1 id="#top">Applying for a room at Hadi's flat</h1>
        Hello Hadi, <br/>
      My name is <strong>John Adams</strong>, 28 years and find the pictures of your apartment very appealing.<br/>
      Hope that you still have capacity for a casting. 
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>Short information about me, myself and I.</b>
      <br/>
      I was born in Ghana, have lived in Germany for 18 years and I
      <br/>
      wish to enrich the internationality in your flat. As a person I am very
      <br/>
      positive - very open-minded, - like to be inspired and available for good
      <br/>
      conversations of any kind. In the last couple years I have built a super
      <br/>
      cool network of the most wonderful people in Berlin and I very much want my
      <br/>
      future flat to enrich it. 
      <br/>
      <i>For example, I have many friendships in the BiPoC.
      and queer community</i>.<br/> <br/>

      <mark>:professionally, I am doing further education in the
      IT industry.  <a href="https://www.digitalcareerinstitute.org/">DCI</a>
      <br/>
      :briefly to the matter with order and cleanliness - because I
      welcome order in the WG also very much :) </mark> 
      <br/>
      <br/>
      In my free time I do sports. Among them jogging, yoga and inline skating. I also like to
      <br/>
      cook and also cook for friends including flat-sharing. I’m always down for a nice flat chillout
      <br/>
      evening or a breakfast on the weekend. I also like art, music, and
      <br/>
      cultural stuff like visiting concerts, vernissage - I think thats the
      <br/>
      reason why I chose to come to Berlin in the first place. And of course the nightlife &#128521;
      <br/>
       I don’t do music myself, but have recently acquired an acoustic guitar
       <br/>
      Anyway, I’m down for a casting of any kind, online, outside, in a bar,
      <br/>
      cafe or just to your place - I would appreciate the opportunity to meet
      <br/>
      for a tea accordingly. 
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Kind regards, 
      <br/>
      John Adams
